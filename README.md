**How might we improve the in-flight catering experience for passengers to increase customer satisfaction and optimize airline operations?**

## Project Description 🤯
WAAke is an application that allows users to set preferences and customize their experience. Specifically, WAAke allows users to choose whether or not to be awoken during the catering service. WAAke thrives to increase customer satisfaction, flight attendants' employee experience, and optimize in flight operations.


## Project Value 💰
Our target customer is American Airline customers. We want them to be able to enjoy all their perks while in flight. Currently in flight experience are directly connected to catering services provided by the flight attendents. As well as satifying the customers we want to increase the operations of the airline overall. By allowing flight attendents to prepare from diet soda, service times are decreased. Also when customers chose to be woken up to recieve bevergaes they then use more supplies and reduce the food waste, while optimizing the customer experience.**
